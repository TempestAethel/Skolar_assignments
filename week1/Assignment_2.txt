IDE Selection Choose a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from the following options: 
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Jupyter Notebook. 
Install the selected IDE on your computer.

I had VS code , so i left it at that.
For those who are reading to know which is better:
Jupyter Notebook:
Strengths:
Interactive Data Exploration: Great for experimenting with code, visualizing data, and rapid prototyping. Easy to combine code, text, and visualizations in one document.
Collaboration: Well-suited for sharing and explaining your work with others due to its clear and formatted structure.
Weaknesses:
Less Efficient Coding: Not ideal for large-scale, complex code projects. Lacks advanced debugging features compared to VS Code.
Version Control: Version control with notebooks can be cumbersome compared to traditional code files.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
Strengths:
Powerful Code Editor: Excellent for writing, editing, and debugging complex code. Offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring.
Version Control Integration: Seamless integration with Git version control for easy tracking of code changes.
Jupyter Notebook Support: VS Code supports working with Jupyter Notebooks directly, allowing you to combine the strengths of both tools.
Weaknesses:
Less Interactive: Not as user-friendly for rapid data exploration and visualization as Jupyter Notebooks.

In essence:
Choose Jupyter Notebook if: Your focus is on data exploration, visualization, explaining code, or collaboration.
Choose VS Code if: You need a robust code editor for large-scale development projects, advanced debugging, or prefer a more traditional coding environment.
