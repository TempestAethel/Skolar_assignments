Install a Python library of your choice within your Colab notebook (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). 
Write code to demonstrate the usage of the installed library. 
Perform a basic operation or visualization. 
Invite a classmate or friend to collaborate on your Colab notebook. 
Provide their email address to send an invitation. 
Collaborate on a simple Python code project or data analysis task within the notebook. 
Save your Colab notebook to your Google Drive. 
Share the saved notebook with your instructor or a peer, allowing them to view or comment on your work.

# Install Matplotlib (if not already installed)
!pip install matplotlib
# Import Matplotlib and pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Create some sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [3, 7, 1, 8, 2]
# Create a line plot
plt.plot(x, y)
# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.title("Sample Line Plot")
# Display the plot
plt.show()

I didn't need a collaborator for this , so preferred solo now 
Though when needed i can handle a team 
simple Python code project or data analysis task within the notebook:
