Git is a version control system that tracks changes in computer files over time. It's like a time machine for your code, allowing you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate efficiently with others.
In software development, Git is essential for managing codebases, especially in large projects with multiple developers. It prevents overwrites, keeps a history of changes, and enables teams to work on different features simultaneously without conflicts. Its speed, efficiency, and flexibility have made it the industry standard.

Git is a version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in computer files over time. It's a tool that developers install on their local machines to manage their code.
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Git, along with additional features like issue tracking, code review, and collaboration tools.To summarize:
Git is the software that does the version control work.

GitHub is a service that makes it easier to use Git and offers additional features.

since the assignments needed individual uploads 
i uploaded and named the repository as per my interest -'Skolar_assignments'
there was no code to fork or pull requests of 
though i understood the process of it 

Process of Cloning the Repository :
Navigate to your repository: Go to the GitHub page of your "my-first-repo" repository.
Copy the clone URL: Click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH clone URL.
Open your terminal: Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Navigate to the desired directory: Use the cd command to change to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Clone the repository: Paste the copied clone URL and press Enter.

Collaborative Workflow is as follows:
Invite a collaborator:
  Go to our repository's settings.
  Click on "Collaborators".
  Add our classmate or friend's GitHub username to add them as Collaborators.
Collaborator forks the repository:
  Our collaborator clicks the "Fork" button on your repository's page to create a copy in their account.
Collaborator makes changes:
  Our collaborator clones their forked repository to their local machine.
  They make changes to the code.
  They commit and push the changes to their forked repository.
Collaborator creates a pull request:
  Our collaborator goes to their forked repository on GitHub.
  They click the "Pull request" button.
  They select the base repository (Our original repository) and the head fork (their fork).
  They write a description of their changes and submit the pull request.
We review and merge the pull request:
  We receive a notification about the pull request.
  We review the changes and provide feedback if necessary.
  If We're satisfied, We merge the pull request into your main branch.




Assignment3:Version Control with GitBranching: 
Create a new branch in your Git repository called "feature-branch." 
Make changes to a file in this branch and commit them. 
Provide a screenshot of the branch creation and commit process.
Merging: Merge the "feature-branch" into the main branch. 
Explain the merge process and resolve any conflicts if they occur

1. Create a new branch:
git branch feature-branch

2. Switch to the new branch:
git checkout feature-branch

3. Make changes to a file:
Edit a file in your project.

4. Stage the changes:
git add <file_name>

5. Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Added a new feature"

Merging the Feature Branch into Main
1. Switch to the main branch:
git checkout main

2. Merge the feature branch:
git merge feature-branch

Understanding the Merge Process
When you merge a branch, Git attempts to combine the changes from both branches into a single commit. If there are no conflicts (i.e., both branches have made changes to different parts of the same file), the merge is straightforward. However, if there are conflicts, Git will stop the merge process and indicate the files with conflicts.
Resolving Conflicts

If there are conflicts, you'll need to manually resolve them. Git will mark the conflicting sections in the file with special markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>). You'll need to edit the file to decide which changes to keep.

Example:
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the main branch version
=======
This is the feature branch version
>>>>>>> feature-branch

You would then edit the file to choose between the two versions or combine them as needed.
Once the conflicts are resolved:
git add <conflicted_file>
git commit -m "Merged feature-branch with conflict resolution"
