Here's a summary of topics covered in a Python tutorial (GeekforGeeks was more than enough,instead of making 5 summary ,the following is a brief single summarisation )
1. Introduction and Setup:
Getting started with Python installation and environments.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language-tutorial/
https://realpython.com/tutorials/basics/
https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming

2.  Basic Syntax:
Variables, data types (numbers, strings, booleans) and operators.
Printing to the console:
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)

3. Control Flow:
Conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for/while)
Simple program to check if a number is even or odd:
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
  print(number, "is even")
else:
  print(number, "is odd")

4. Functions:
Defining functions to organize code and improve reusability.
A function to calculate area of a rectangle:
def area_of_rectangle(length, width):
  """Calculates the area of a rectangle"""
  return length * width
# Calling the function
rectangle_area = area_of_rectangle(5, 4)
print("Area of rectangle:", rectangle_area)

5. Data Structures:
Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets for storing and organizing data.
Iterating through elements in a list:
Python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)

6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

7. Error Handling:
Using try/except blocks to handle exceptions and prevent program crashes.

8. Input/Output:
Reading user input and working with files.

9.  Modules and Packages:
Importing and using modules/packages to extend functionality.

10. More Advanced Topics:
Regular expressions, web scraping, data analysis libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
