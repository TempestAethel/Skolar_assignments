Summary of the key concepts and features covered in the tutorial is as follows
Fundamentals:
Basics: Setting up your environment, variables, data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.), operators (performing calculations and comparisons).
Control Flow: Using conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for/while) to control the execution path of your code based on conditions.
Functions: Defining reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can take arguments and return values.

Data Structures:
Lists: Ordered collections of items that can be changed (mutable). Useful for storing sequences of data.
Tuples: Ordered collections similar to lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
Sets: Unordered collections of unique items. Useful for checking membership and removing duplicates.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections that store key-value pairs. Powerful for associating data with labels.

Advanced Concepts (depending on the tutorial's depth):
Modules and Packages: Organizing code into reusable building blocks for better maintainability.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for structuring your code and creating reusable components.
Exception Handling: Gracefully handling errors and unexpected situations to make your code more robust.
File Handling: Reading from and writing to files for data persistence.
